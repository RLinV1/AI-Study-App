**Java 101 for Beginners: An Overview**

1. **Programming Environment**
   - A programming environment where you write code and read code.

2. **Java Basics**
   - Java is a programming language that allows you to store data using variables and create objects.
   - Objects are like real-life things, like a person or a car, and they have properties and methods.

3. **Variables**
   - Variables are used to store data in Java.
   - There are two types of variables: primitive types and non-primitive types.
   - Primitive types are built-in data types like int, char, and boolean, while non-primitive types are custom data types like String and ArrayList.

4. **Data Types**
   - Strings are used to store text data.
   - Arrays are used to store multiple values of the same data type.
   - Methods are blocks of code that perform specific tasks.

5. **Operators**
   - Arithmetic operators (+, -, \*, /, etc.)
   - Comparison operators (==,!=, <, >, etc.)
   - Logical operators (&&, ||,!, etc.)

6. **Control Structures**
   - If statements: used to control the flow of a program.
   - Loops (for, while)
   - Methods: blocks of code that perform specific tasks.

7. **Exception Handling**
   - Try-catch statements: used to handle exceptions that may occur during program execution.
   - Exceptions are errors that may occur in a program.

8. **APIs and External Libraries**
   - APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are used to access external libraries and services.
   - External libraries can be downloaded and used in a program.

9. **Variables and Data Types**
   - Variables can be used to store data of different types.
   - Variables can be declared using the `public`, `private`, and `protected` keywords.

10. **Example Code**
    - A simple example of a Java program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
    - A simple program that uses if-else statements to print different messages based on a condition.
    - A program that uses a for loop to print numbers from 1 to 10.
